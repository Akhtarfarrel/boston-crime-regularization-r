# boston-crime-regularization-r
This repository contains my R workflow for modelling the per-capita crime rate (crim) in the Boston housing dataset. I compare multiple approaches—full and reduced OLS, best subset and stepwise selection, lasso, ridge, and principal component regression—using a consistent train–test split and test MSE to evaluate out-of-sample performance.
